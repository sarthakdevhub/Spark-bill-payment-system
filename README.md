# Bill payment System
The Electricity bill corporation of Rajasthan has provided an application to view/pay bills
to consumers. Bills are generated monthly i.e. bill cycle is from the 1st of every month to
the last day of the month. Bill is computed on behalf of a fixed charge for connection +
units consumed (10/- per unit) + Taxes (2.5% of total bill) + Adjustment (if any, such that
adjustment can be in favor of consumer/corporation like due to any advanced payment,
inflated meter reading, pending previous month bill, etc.)
There are 2 users in the system:
1. Administrator
2. Consumer
## The Role of the Administrator:

username and password fixed for admin (like username: ‘admin’ password: ‘admin’)
